A Rust implementation of [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) for producing and consuming asyncronous tasks with a distributed message queue.

Inspired by, well... Celery, but also [batch-rs](https://github.com/kureuil/batch-rs) especially for it's awesome macro implementation.

## Features

- Send tasks from Python to Rust or vice versa ‚ÜîÔ∏è
- Use provided brokers and backends (coming soon) or implement your own üîß
- Natural async / await interface üéá
- High performance and safe üî• üî• üî•

## Getting started

The `./examples` directory contains a simple Celery app that is implemented in both Rust ([celery_app.rs](https://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery/blob/master/examples/celery_app.rs)) and Python ([celery_app.py](https://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery/blob/master/examples/celery_app.py)) using an AMQP broker. 

Before running the examples you'll need to have the broker set up. RabbitMQ is a popular implementation of the AMQP protocol and provides a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq) that you can run locally. Another option would be to use a hosting provider like [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/), which provides a free tier broker for development purposes.

Once you have your broker running, set the environment variable `AMQP_ADDR` to your broker URL. I also recommend setting `RUST_LOG=debug`. Then you can send a task from Python to Rust by running the script

```bash
./examples/python_to_rust.sh
```

And send a task from Rust to Python by running

```bash
./examples/rust_to_python.sh
```
